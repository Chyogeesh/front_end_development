Tech Stack Choices:

Frontend Framework: ReactJS offers a structured approach for building complex UIs with reusable components. Vanilla JS allows for more control but might require more boilerplate code.
Animation Library: GSAP is a powerful animation library for creating smooth and complex animations. WebGL offers 3D graphics capabilities, but it has a steeper learning curve.
Steps:

Project Setup:

Create a new project directory and choose your preferred frontend framework (e.g., create-react-app for React).
Install any additional libraries (e.g., GSAP).
Structure and Layout:

Use HTML and CSS (or a styling library like Tailwind CSS or Material UI) to create the basic structure of the page, dividing it into sections like header, content, and footer.
Refer to the Motion Art Effect home page for visual guidance on layout and design.
Animations:

Use GSAP or WebGL to implement the various animations present on the page. These might include:
Parallax scrolling effect
Text animations (e.g., typing animations)
Image/shape transitions
Hover effects on buttons and elements
Explore the documentation and tutorials for your chosen animation library to create the desired effects.
Interactivity (Optional):

Implement any interactive elements present on the page, such as buttons, forms, or sliders.
Use JavaScript event listeners to handle user interaction and trigger animations or modify UI elements.
Responsiveness:

Ensure your layout and styling adapt to different screen sizes and devices using CSS media queries or a responsive framework.
Deployment:

Upload your project files to a hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) or run a local development server.
Delivery:

Share the GitHub repository link and deployment link/video with Anmol or PM at Heliverse.
Additional Notes:

Use the provided assets (fonts, images) for consistency with the original design.
Refer to online tutorials and documentation for your chosen libraries (React, GSAP, styling library).
Break down the complex animations into smaller, manageable steps.
Test your implementation thoroughly on different devices and browsers.
